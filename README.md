# stroop-pnlcomp, for neu/psy 330 spring 2019 

this repo replicates cohen et al (1990) w/ psyneulink composition (version==0.5.2.1)

here's the model...

here's the main result, meant to qualitatively replicate fig 5 from cohen et al (1990). so in general, color naming is slower than word reading; color naming *red green* as "red" is much slower than word reading *red green* as "green", where *red green* = the word green painted in red.

here's another way to plot the data. these are kernel density estimates of the reaction time distributions.
