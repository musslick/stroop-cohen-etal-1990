this repo replicates

w/ psyneulink composition (version==0.5.2.1)

### doc 

files: 
- `stroop_model.py`: the definition of the stroop model
- `stroop_stimulus.py`: the definition of the stroop task
- `run_exp_stroop.py`: run the standard stroop experiment
- `run_exp_soa.py`: run SOA experiment
- `analyze_soa.py`: analyze and plot the data generated by `run_exp_soa.py`
- `stroop-feedforward.ipynb` and `stroop-linear.ipynb`: two simplifications of the full stroop model, for teaching purpose


### the full model

here's the architecture...

### results

here's the main result, meant to qualitatively replicate fig 5 from cohen et al (1990). so in general, color naming is slower than word reading; color naming *red green* as "red" is much slower than word reading *red green* as "green", where *red green* = the word green painted in red.

here's another way to plot the data. these are kernel density estimates of the reaction time distributions.

and here's the SOA effect:
